# Geometry-Calculations-Android-App
This repository contains my completed project for the "Geometry Calculations" assignment. It's a basic Android app for computing geometric shapes' properties like area and perimeter. It features a simple interface for easy input and results display, making it ideal for learning basic geometry on Android.
